# ❤ My love dotfiles ❤

My dotfiles for my little linux.
I use the beautiful and majestic Arch Linux with DWM as my window manager.

# Install my dotfiles

To install my dotfiles, you have to enter the `stow_home` directory and then just run the command:
```sh
stow APPLICATION
```

# Uninstall my dotfiles

To uninstall my dotfiles, you have to enter the `stow_home` directory and then just run the command:
```sh
stow -D APPLICATION
```
